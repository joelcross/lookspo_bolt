# Lookspo

Lookspo is a minimal, avant-garde platform for curating and saving creative inspiration as it relates to fashion.  
Built with a focus on **authenticity**, **self-expression**, and **distraction-free design**, it offers a refreshing alternative to traditional social media.

While platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and VSCO dominate visual inspiration in the mainstream, **Lookspo** differentiates itself through a more **avant-garde** and **design-forward** experience.

With this being a solo project, I am the full-stack software engineer and product designer behind Lookspo.
I designed the UX/UI, built the frontend architecture, integrated Supabase for backend functionality, and developed the design system for a cohesive visual language.

The idea behind Lookspo is to encourage inspiration within users and give them an outlet for curating content in a unique and thoughtful way that prioritizes authenticity. I envision Lookspo becoming the go-to platform for those seeking a refreshing and doom-free online experience that values originality and personal expression.
